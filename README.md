# Customer-Segmentation-using-KMeans

## Overview
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation with KMeans GitHub repository! This project focuses on using the KMeans machine learning algorithm to segment customers based on various features. The process includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier treatment, visualization, feature engineering, and model development using KMeans. The elbow method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Usage
This project is designed to help businesses segment their customers based on certain features. The Jupyter notebooks and excel file guide you through the entire process, from EDA to model development and interpretation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The initial phase involves exploring the dataset, understanding feature distributions, detecting outliers, and visualizing relationships between variables.

## Data Preprocessing
Includes handling missing values, outlier treatment, converting categorical features into numerical using dummy variables, and scaling the data.

## Model Development
Utilizes the KMeans algorithm for customer segmentation. The elbow method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Results
Visualizations and insights obtained from the segmentation process.
